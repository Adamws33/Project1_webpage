<div class="aboutUs">
  Indy v ballers was started in 2013 by Adam Smith.  Indy V Ballers was innitially intended to just help bring some competititon amungst friends 
  from an open ameature volleyball meet up.  After the first event was such a success a small amount of word of mouth, and advertising set things
  in motion for what Indy V Ballers is today and what it will once become.  
<br><br><br><br>
  With the interest in events rising every year with more and more requests for events Indy V Ballers hopes to one day break into more and more
  cometitive events.  Earning advertising and professional contracts to host bigger and bigger events.  
<br><br><br><br>
  There are currently 2 members of Indy V Ballers Adam and Danay Smith.  With our mascot Guinness! Within the next couple years we hope that
  interest will rise to the point where we can hire someone to help run the events.
